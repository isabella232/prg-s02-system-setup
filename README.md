# Intel NUC & Ubuntu

The following instruction assumes you have a bootable Ubuntu intallation USB thumbdrive.

1. Connect NUC.
    - Insert the intallation USB thumbdrive.
    - Connect monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
    - **Connect ethernet cable**: we'll get internet this way. Otherwise, connect to WiFi other than "PRG-MIT" during Ubuntu installation.
    - Connect power cable.

2. Power on NUC.

3. Auto start when power plugged in
    - Press F2 instantly when powered on Intel Nuc. 
    - After entering BIOS settings, go to advanced > power > after power failure, select ‘power on’ instead of ‘stay off’. 
    - Save and exit with F10.

4. Install Ubuntu. We use 16.04 LTS desktop image built for NUCs.
    - Settings
      - User Name: prg
      - Computer name:  as in the lable on the NUC, e.g., s02-n01-nuc-01
      - Password: (ask Hae Won)
      - Select Login Automatically.
    - If you're connected via ethernet, skip wifi connection. If not, **connect to any other than "PRG-MIT"**
    - Open System Settings -> Power and select "Don't suspend" under "Suspend when inactive" for menu.
 
5. Clone this repo.
    - `sudo apt install -y git`
    - `git clone https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-s02-system-setup`

6. Run the installation script.
    - `cd prg-s02-system-setup`
    - `./install_nuc.sh`
    - If prompted for teamviewer configuration file setup, enter Y.
    - If prompted for update Ubuntu, do not.
    - Check for errors, but don't worry about the error about unable to find /dev/video0 when starting USB_CAM docker container.

7. Setup TeamViewer
    - `sudo teamviewer setup`
      - ID: robots.deployment@gmail.com
      - Password: (ask Hae Won)
    - **Don't forget to check email to add the NUC as trusted device.** If you don't do this, you won't be able to log in.
    - Given an option, select 'y' to add the NUC to the account.

8. Test
    - Test ssh into the new NUC from another machine on the same Network.
